# Offshore Hybrid Energy Platform

A modular simulation framework for integrated offshore renewable energy systems,
combining **offshore wind (fixed & floating)**, **wave energy**, and **floating solar**
into a single coupled physical platform.

## Motivation
Offshore renewable energy systems are moving toward **hybrid and floating solutions**
to improve energy stability, spatial efficiency, and long-term sustainability.
This project aims to provide a **research-grade yet buildable simulation platform**
for such systems.

## Core Features
- 3D wind field simulation (RANS-based)
- Actuator Disk / Actuator Line wind turbine models
- Linear and spectral wave modeling
- Fixed-bottom and floating platform dynamics (6 DOF)
- Mooring and foundation modeling
- Integrated energy performance assessment (wind–wave–solar)

## Scope
This software is **not** intended to replace OpenFOAM or ANSYS.
It focuses on **specialized offshore hybrid energy systems**
with simplified but physically consistent models.

## Intended Use
- PhD and academic research
- Offshore renewable energy feasibility studies
- Education and training
- Future professional and consulting tools

## Long-Term Vision
- Hybrid offshore energy optimization
- Digital twin foundations
- Coupled wind–wave–platform simulations
- Scalable architecture for future extensions
