# Concept Overview

This project models an integrated offshore renewable energy platform where
offshore wind (fixed and floating), wave energy, and floating solar systems
are coupled into a single physical object.

The platform shares:
- Environmental forcing (wind, wave, current)
- Structural dynamics
- Energy performance evaluation

This document describes the conceptual foundation of the platform.
